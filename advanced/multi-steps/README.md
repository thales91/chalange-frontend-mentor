## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - For global state
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Components
  

### What I learned

I learned more about Shadcn components, I practiced using global state using zustand, I practiced a little more with responsive Tailwind CSS


### Continued development

I intend to delve deeper into tailwind to speed up the development time of an application and always evolving javascript in parallel
