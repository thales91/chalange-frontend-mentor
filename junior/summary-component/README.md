## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles


### What I learned


project helped reinforce ways to customize Tailwindcss and practice the various classes already existing in the library

```js
   colors: {
        "light-red": "hsl(0, 100%, 67%)",
        "orangey-yellow": "hsl(39, 100%, 56%)",
        "green-teal": "hsl(166, 100%, 37%)",
        "cobalt-blue": "hsl(234, 85%, 45%)",
        "slate-blue": "hsl(252, 100%, 67%)",
        "royal-blue": "hsl(241, 81%, 54%)",
        "violet-blue": "hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1)",
        "persian-blue": "hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0)",
        "pale-blue": "hsl(221, 100%, 89%)",
        "light-lavender": "hsl(241, 100%, 89%)",
        "dark-gray-blue": "hsl(224, 30%, 27%)",
      },
```


### Continued development

I intend to delve deeper into tailwind to speed up the development time of an application and always evolving javascript in parallel
